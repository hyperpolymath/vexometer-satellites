Umbrella documentation hub for the link:https://github.com/hyperpolymath/vexometer[vexometer] satellite intervention system.

== Overview

*Vexometer* is a diagnostic instrument that measures AI assistant irritation surfaces across 10 dimensions. *Satellites* are independent intervention tools that reduce specific irritation metrics.

[quote]
____
Vexometer *measures* irritation. Satellites *fix* it.
____

This repository serves as:

* *Central documentation hub* for the satellite ecosystem
* *Integration protocol specifications* (vexometer-trace-v1, vexometer-efficacy-v1)
* *Development roadmap* and priorities
* *Registry* of all satellite repositories

== Integration Protocols

=== vexometer-trace-v1

== Development Guide

=== Creating a New Satellite

1. *Use the template*:
+
[source,bash]
----
gh repo create hyperpolymath/vex-YOUR-SATELLITE \
  --template hyperpolymath/vex-satellite-template \
  --public
----

2. *Follow RSR standards*:
   * SPDX headers on all files
   * ECOSYSTEM.scm, META.scm, STATE.scm
   * SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.adoc, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
   * .well-known/ compliance

3. *Implement core interface*:
   * Input: LLM response text
   * Output: Modified response with reduced irritation
   * Optional: vexometer-trace-v1 before/after data

4. *Validate efficacy*:
   * Collect before/after traces
   * Run statistical analysis
   * Document in EFFICACY.adoc

5. *Register here*:
   * Add to satellite registry table
   * Link to repository
   * Update status

=== Recommended Languages

* *Rust* - Primary for most satellites (performance, safety)
* *Ada/SPARK* - Formal verification where needed
* *Elixir/OTP* - Orchestration, stateful services
* *Haskell* - Pure logic, type-heavy reasoning

*Avoid*: Python, JavaScript, Go per RSR language policy.

=== Testing Standards

All satellites must include:

* Unit tests with ≥80% coverage
* Integration tests with vexometer
* Before/after trace samples (≥50 examples)
* Statistical validation (p < 0.05)

== Roadmap

* [ ] Implement vex-confidence-calibrator (EFR reduction)
* [ ] Cross-satellite integration testing

=== Phase 3: Ecosystem Expansion (Q3 2026)

* [ ] Implement remaining 8 satellites
* [ ] LMSYS Arena integration proposal
* [ ] Public efficacy benchmark suite
* [ ] Research paper publication

=== Phase 4: Production Readiness (Q4 2026)

* [ ] All 12 satellites operational
* [ ] API service deployment
* [ ] Model vendor partnerships
* [ ] Community contribution program
